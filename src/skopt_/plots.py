    Plot a 2-d matrix with so-called Partial Dependence plots
    of the objective function. This shows the influence of each
    search-space dimension on the objective function.

    This uses the last fitted model for estimating the objective function.

    The diagonal shows the effect of a single dimension on the
    objective function, while the plots below the diagonal show
    the effect on the objective function when varying two dimensions.

    The Partial Dependence is calculated by averaging the objective value 
    for a number of random samples in the search-space,
    while keeping one or two dimensions fixed at regular intervals. This
    averages out the effect of varying the other dimensions and shows
    the influence of one or two dimensions on the objective function.

    Also shown are small black dots for the points that were sampled
    during optimization, and large red stars show the best found points.

    NOTE: The Partial Dependence plot is only an estimation of the surrogate
          model which in turn is only an estimation of the true objective
          function that has been optimized. This means the plots show
          an "estimate of an estimate" and may therefore be quite imprecise,
          especially if few samples have been collected during the optimization
          (e.g. less than 100-200 samples), and in regions of the search-space
          that have been sparsely sampled (e.g. regions away from the optimum).
          This means that the plots may change each time you run the
          optimization and they should not be considered completely reliable.
          These compromises are necessary because we cannot evaluate the
          expensive objective function in order to plot it, so we have to use
          the cheaper surrogate model to plot its contour. And in order to
          show search-spaces with 3 dimensions or more in a 2-dimensional plot,
          we further need to map those dimensions to only 2-dimensions using
          the Partial Dependence, which also causes distortions in the plots.

    NOTE: Search-spaces with `Categorical` dimensions are not supported.

    NOTE: This function can be very slow for dimensions greater than 5.

    Parameters
    ----------
    * `result` [`OptimizeResult`]
        The optimization results from calling e.g. `gp_minimize()`.

    * `levels` [int, default=10]
        Number of levels to draw on the contour plot, passed directly
        to `plt.contour()`.

    * `n_points` [int, default=40]
        Number of points along each dimension where the partial dependence
        is evaluated when generating the contour-plots.

    * `n_samples` [int, default=250]
        Number of points along each dimension where the partial dependence
        is evaluated when generating the contour-plots.

    * `zscale` [str, default='linear']
        Scale to use for the z-axis of the contour plots.
        Either 'log' or linear for all other choices.

    * `dimension_names` [list(str), default=None]:
        List of names for search-space dimensions to be used in the plot.
        You can omit `Categorical` dimensions here as they are not supported.
        If `None` then use all dimensions from the search-space.
